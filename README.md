# Benchmark tests for submitting PCG to core

Clone the `mgold/core` fork locally and check out this branch, `random-pcg-tests`.

Then run `elm-reactor`.

In the browser, navigate to `benchmark/index.html`. The tests will start running.

(If you change anything, you need to run `make` in the `benchmark` directory to recompile.)
